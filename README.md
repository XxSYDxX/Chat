# Chat
**Just a BS**

A global open chatting system that uses a unix console.
You basically log in with any username you want and no password and then start talking lol.


# Pre Requirements
~ Python 3.x

The python modules `discord.py` & `readchar` will be installed on the first run. So the first run will take more time to start.
**If the installation of these modules interfere with your other projects** which is not very likely but you are worried, **don't run ths code.** It ain't worth it.
Only works with advanced Unix or non-traditional windows terminals. Running on the usual command prompt is pretty messy in windows. Also works with Linux terminal emulator installed on a phone.


# Usage
Use the python command you use to run any other python 3 code. The program takes 1 argument which is used as the username you will log in with.

For example:
`python3 Chat.py MyUsername`

will sign you in with the *MyUsername* username.

**Keep the window of your terminal in a portrait shape and small size** for a better experience.

To send any message you hit ENTER, type the message and then hit ENTER again to send it.

It's got plenty of bugs, and I'm not interested in fixing them.
